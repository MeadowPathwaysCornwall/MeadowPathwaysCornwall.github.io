      <h2>Safeguarding</h2>
      <p>
        At Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education, safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do. We are fully committed to creating and maintaining a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for all children, young people, staff, and visitors—both on-site and in the wider community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with children of all ages, including those with neurodiverse needs, trauma-related experiences, EBSNA (Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance), bereavement, and those with Educational Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). We understand that every child’s journey is unique, and safeguarding must be responsive to their individual circumstances. We are proud of our strong Cornish ties and work closely with the Local Authority and a wide range of specialist support services to ensure that no child is left unsupported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our safeguarding practices are rooted in the most current statutory guidance, including <em>Keeping Children Safe in Education</em> and <em>Working Together to Safeguard Children</em>. These are reflected in all our policies, which are reviewed regularly and updated to meet evolving standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility at Meadow Pathways. All staff, volunteers, and visitors are expected to uphold our safeguarding principles. We promote a strong culture of vigilance and accountability, ensuring that all staff receive high-quality, ongoing training in safeguarding and child protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Designated Safeguarding Lead:</strong> Michelle Pascoe has nearly a decade of experience as a DSL and has undertaken extensive safeguarding training, including through Cornwall Local Authority.
