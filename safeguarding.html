      Our Commitment to Safeguarding and Health &amp; Safety
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Meadow Pathways, we take all aspects of safeguarding and health &amp; safety extremely seriously. 
      This includes the welfare and protection of the children and young people we work with, as well as 
      our responsibilities around staff conduct, safe practice, and compliance with relevant legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We adhere fully to up-to-date statutory guidance, including <em>Keeping Children Safe in Education</em> 
      and <em>Working Together to Safeguard Children</em>. All members of staff receive regular safeguarding 
      training and follow robust policies and procedures to ensure a safe and supportive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our commitment extends to all areas of our work in the communityâ€”whether through enrichment activities, 
      therapeutic sessions, or off-site learning. We carry out comprehensive risk assessments and take all 
      necessary measures to ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of everyone involved. We are dedicated 
      to fostering a culture of vigilance, transparency, and care in everything we do.
