      <p>Meadow Pathways places the safety, wellbeing and welfare of children and young people at the centre of everything we do. We are committed to preventing harm, recognising needs early and taking proportionate action to keep learners safe. Safeguarding is the shared responsibility of every adult who works with children, families and partner agencies.</p>

      <h2>Our safeguarding principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Child first</strong> — the child’s welfare is paramount and we always consider what is in the best interests of the child.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention</strong> — we create safe, nurturing environments and use trauma-informed practice to reduce risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Early help</strong> — we respond quickly to emerging needs and work with families and partners to provide timely support.</li>
        <li><strong>Proportionality</strong> — responses are proportionate to the level of need or risk identified.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> — we share information on a need-to-know basis to protect children while respecting family privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-agency working</strong> — we collaborate with local safeguarding partners, health and education services to achieve the best outcomes for children.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reporting concerns</h2>
      <p>If you are concerned that a child or young person is being harmed, abused or neglected, act without delay. In an emergency where a child is at immediate risk, contact the emergency services. For non-emergencies, report concerns to the Designated Safeguarding Lead at Meadow Pathways and, where required, to the local authority children's social care team and other relevant partners.</p>
