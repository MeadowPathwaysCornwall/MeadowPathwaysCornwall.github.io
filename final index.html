        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Meadow Pathways Cornwall Education, our mission is to provide compassionate, personalised, and therapeutic learning experiences for children and young people with SEMH needs who are unable to access mainstream education.
          Rooted in nature, wellbeing, and inclusion, we create safe spaces where every learner is valued, supported, and empowered to grow—academically, emotionally, and socially.
          We work in close partnership with families and local authorities to ensure every child’s right to a meaningful, tailored education is fulfilled.
