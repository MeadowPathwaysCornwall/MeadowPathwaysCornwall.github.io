    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Welcome to Meadow Pathways Cornwall</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education</strong>, we provide bespoke, therapeutic, and educational support for children and young people who need something different. We are an <strong>EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School)</strong> provider based in Cornwall, offering flexible, nurturing learning experiences beyond the traditional classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We support children and young people with a wide range of needs, including those who are <strong>neurodiverse</strong>, have experienced <strong>bereavement</strong> or <strong>trauma</strong>, are affected by <strong>emotionally based school non-attendance (EBSNA)</strong>, or who have faced <strong>educational trauma</strong>. Our learners all have an <strong>Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)</strong>, and our work is shaped by the provisions and aspirations outlined in each plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every childâ€™s journey is unique. We guide those journeys with <strong>care, compassion, and purpose</strong> â€” helping each learner grow in confidence and find their place in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <strong>strong Cornish roots</strong>, Meadow Pathways is proud to work closely with <strong>Cornwall Council</strong> and a wide network of <strong>specialist support services</strong> to ensure the best possible outcomes for our young people. Together, we believe in restoring trust in education and offering meaningful pathways forward.
