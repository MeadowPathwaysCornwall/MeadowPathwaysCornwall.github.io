    <h1>Welcome to Meadow Pathways Cornwall</h1>
    <p>
      
      <strong>Meadow Pathways Cornwall</strong> is dedicated to supporting children and young people through a holistic, trauma-informed approach to education and well-being. Based in the heart of Cornwall, we specialise in providing nurturing, individualised support for those who may not thrive in mainstream school environments, including learners with neurodivergent profiles, trauma experiences, EBSNA (Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance), bereavement, and those with Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team is passionate about creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment where every child and young person is empowered to flourish. We work closely with families, local authorities, schools, and a wide range of specialist services to ensure a truly collaborative approach to well-being and education.
    </p>

    <p>
      We offer a range of bespoke packages, including <strong>Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</strong> provisions, on-site therapeutic education, and outreach into the community. Our flexible, creative programmes are designed to ignite curiosity, build confidence, and enable every learner to develop their strengths and interests.
