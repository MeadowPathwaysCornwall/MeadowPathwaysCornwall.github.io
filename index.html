    <h1>Welcome to Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education Cornwall</h1>
    <p>
      Meadow Pathways Cornwall is a bespoke education and well-being service that supports children and young people with complex or additional needs, including those with Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). We specialise in delivering creative, therapeutic, and personalised learning experiences for young people who may not be thriving in traditional school environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through our EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) provision, we guide learners along individual journeys—offering flexible, meaningful pathways that support emotional wellbeing and educational growth. Whether through land-based learning, mentoring, therapeutic support, or tailored academic interventions, our approach is rooted in compassion, care, and purposeful guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Meadow Pathways, we believe that every child has a unique path. We walk alongside them with understanding and integrity, helping them to explore their interests, build resilience, and grow in confidence. Our work is grounded in the belief that learning flourishes when children feel safe, heard, and valued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dedicated team brings together expertise in education, therapy, outdoor learning, and SEND provision. Together, we create nurturing environments where every young person is empowered to follow their path and reach their potential—on their terms, in their time.
