    <h1>Welcome to Meadow Pathways Cornwall</h1>
    <p>At Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education, we believe every young person deserves a route that works for them. Our specialist EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) provision offers therapeutic, flexible support that follows the learner â€” not the other way around.</p>
    <p>Like pathways through a meadow, no two journeys are the same. We walk alongside each child, offering choice, guidance, and care, helping them navigate challenges and reconnect with learning in a way that feels safe, meaningful, and empowering.</p>
    <p>Our bespoke programmes support children and young people with SEMH needs, neurodiversity, or those unable to access traditional settings. Through personalised teaching, enrichment, and well-being sessions, we create space for growth, confidence, and hope.</p>
