    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At Meadow Pathway Cornwall Education, our mission is to provide compassionate, personalised, and therapeutic learning experiences for children and young people with SEMH needs who are unable to access mainstream education.</p>
    <p>Rooted in nature, wellbeing, and inclusion, we create safe spaces where every learner is valued, supported, and empowered to growâ€”academically, emotionally, and socially.</p>
    <p>We work in close partnership with families and local authorities to ensure every childâ€™s right to a meaningful, tailored education is fulfilled.</p>

  <!-- Vision Statement -->
  <section class="vision">
    <h2>ðŸŒ± Our Vision</h2>
    <p>At Meadow Pathway Cornwall Education, our vision is to create an inclusive, nurturing educational centre that serves children and young people who face Social, Emotional, and Mental Health (SEMH) challenges, alongside Special Educational Needs (SEN). We are committed to offering a safe, calm, and supportive environment where learners feel valued, empowered, and understood.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Promote Emotional Wellbeing:</strong> Through mindfulness practices, therapeutic interventions, and personalised emotional support, we help young people build confidence, self-awareness, and emotional regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Personalised, Child-Centred Learning:</strong> Each learner receives a tailored curriculum that reflects their needs, strengths, and interestsâ€”delivered by a skilled and compassionate team who understand the complexities of SEMH and SEN.</li>
      <li><strong>Embed Therapeutic Practice:</strong> Our work is guided by professionals with backgrounds in education, mental health, and family support. Together, we provide wraparound care that includes input from therapists, educational psychologists, and pastoral staff.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Nature as a Tool for Engagement and Growth:</strong> Outdoor education, forest school principles, and rural learning spaces form a key part of our offerâ€”encouraging curiosity, building resilience, and helping students reconnect with learning in a low-pressure environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Foster Belonging and Connection:</strong> We create a community where children and families feel heard, respected, and involved. Strong, trusting relationships sit at the heart of everything we do.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Pathways to Progression:</strong> Our aim is not just to stabilise and support, but to help each young person grow into a confident, independent learnerâ€”ready for reintegration into mainstream education, or prepared for further training, employment, or life skills development.</li>
    </ul>
