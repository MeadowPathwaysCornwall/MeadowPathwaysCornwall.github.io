    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education provides personalised, therapeutic education for children and young people in Key Stages 2 to 4. Our approach is grounded in deep understanding of neurodiversity and emotional development, with a focus on building confidence, connection, and lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>We work with children and young people who may have diagnoses such as Autism, ADHD, PDA, Dyslexia, OCD, and SEMH, or who simply find traditional settings challenging. Sessions are led by experienced education and well-being professionals, offered both in-person and online, and tailored to the individual’s strengths, interests, and goals.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to offer a flexible, responsive alternative to conventional education — one that enables each learner to feel safe, seen, and successful.</p>
