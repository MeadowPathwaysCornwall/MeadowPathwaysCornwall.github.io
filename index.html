    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education provides personalised, therapeutic education for children and young people in Key Stages 2 to 4. Our approach is grounded in deep understanding of neurodiversity and emotional development, with a focus on building confidence, connection, and lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>We work with children and young people who may have diagnoses such as Autism, ADHD, PDA, Dyslexia, OCD, and SEMH, or who simply find traditional settings challenging. Sessions are led by experienced education and well-being professionals, offered both in-person and online, and tailored to the individual’s strengths, interests, and goals.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to offer a flexible, responsive alternative to conventional education — one that enables each learner to feel safe, seen, and successful.</p>
    <h3>Enrichment</h3>
    <p>We believe that meaningful learning goes beyond the classroom. Our enrichment programme provides opportunities to build skills, foster connection, and enjoy new experiences in real-world settings.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Therapeutic animal and farm-based sessions</li>
      <li>Outdoor activities and nature-based exploration</li>
      <li>Fitness and movement sessions in the community</li>
      <li>Structured social outings to build confidence and independence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every activity is carefully planned to match the needs of the individual learner. Where relevant, enrichment is aligned to outcomes in Education, Health and Care Plans, supporting growth across all areas of development.</p>
    <h3>Bespoke Support</h3>
    <p>At Meadow Pathways, we recognise that each learner’s journey is unique. Our support is highly adaptable, designed in collaboration with families and professionals to create truly individualised pathways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-to-one mentoring and well-being support</li>
      <li>Emotional regulation and social communication interventions</li>
      <li>Tailored PSHE programmes</li>
      <li>Advocacy and preparation for transitions into new settings</li>
      <li>Life skills and confidence-building sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether a young person needs short-term support, long-term mentoring, or a fully personalised education package, we are committed to meeting them where they are — and helping them move forward with purpose and support.</p>
