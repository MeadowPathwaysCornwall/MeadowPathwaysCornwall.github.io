    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Welcome to Meadow Pathways Cornwall</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education</strong>, we provide bespoke, therapeutic, and educational support for children and young people who need something different.
    </p>
    <p>
      We specialise in <strong>EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School)</strong> provision in Cornwall â€” offering flexible, nurturing learning experiences that happen beyond the classroom. Whether itâ€™s land-based learning, creative therapy, mentoring, or guided life skills, we walk beside each young person on their own unique path.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with children and young people of all ages, particularly those with <strong>neurodiverse needs</strong>, in accordance with their <strong>Education, Health and Care (EHC) Plans</strong>. Our experienced team builds trusted relationships that support each learnerâ€™s strengths, interests, and well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every journey is different, and weâ€™re here to guide it with <strong>care, compassion, and purpose</strong>, helping children flourish in a way that works for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <strong>strong Cornish roots</strong>, Meadow Pathways is proud to work in close partnership with <strong>Cornwall Council</strong> and a wide network of <strong>specialist support services</strong>. Together, we ensure that every child receives the tailored support they deserve, right here in their own community.
