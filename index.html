    <h1>Welcome to Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</h1>
    <p><em>Guiding Individual Journeys with Care and Purpose.</em></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> is dedicated to supporting children and young people through a holistic, trauma-informed approach to learning and personal development. Based in the heart of Cornwall, we specialise in nurturing, individualised education for learners who may not thrive in mainstream environments, including those with neurodivergent profiles, trauma experiences, EBSNA (Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance), bereavement, and Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team is passionate about creating safe, inclusive, and supportive spaces where every child and young person is empowered to flourish. We work closely with families, local authorities, schools, and a wide range of specialist services to ensure a genuinely collaborative approach to wellbeing and education.
    </p>

    <p>
      We offer bespoke programmes including <strong>Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</strong> provisions, therapeutic learning, and community-based outreach. Our creative, flexible approach is designed to build confidence, develop strengths, and inspire curiosity in every learner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Curriculum-linked activities are tailored to each child’s interests and readiness. We offer ASDAN and AQA Unit Awards, functional skills, and life skills development, alongside therapeutic sessions in nature, play, and creative expression. Every provision is shaped by the SPACE ethos — Safety, Presence, Attunement, Connection, and Empowerment.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Child-Centred:</strong> Every learner’s journey is unique. We place children and young people at the heart of all we do.</li>
      <li><strong>Trauma-Informed:</strong> Our staff are trained in trauma-sensitive approaches to ensure safety and trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We work in partnership with families, professionals, and the wider community.</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> We celebrate diversity and champion every learner’s right to be heard and respected.</li>
      <li><strong>Wellbeing:</strong> Emotional, social, and mental wellbeing are central to our practice.</li>
    </ul>
