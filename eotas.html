    <img src="arrow.png" alt="" style="width: 95px; margin-right: 10px;"> <h1> What is EOTAS?</h1><p><strong>EOTAS</strong> stands for <em>Education Otherwise Than At School</em>. It is a tailored education provision arranged by the Local Authority for children and young people who have an <strong>Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)</strong> but cannot have their needs met in a mainstream or special school setting.</p>
    <p>At Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education, we specialise in delivering EOTAS packages across Cornwall that are creative, compassionate, and entirely bespoke — reflecting the unique journey of each young person we support.</p>
    
    <p>EOTAS is not a parent-led choice like Elective Home Education — it is a legal arrangement, agreed by Cornwall Council, when professionals agree that school is not appropriate and alternative provision is required.</p>

    <h2>How does EOTAS work?</h2><img src="Book.jpg" alt="" style="width: 95px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <p>Under Section 61 of the Children and Families Act 2014, Cornwall Council can agree to provide education outside of a school when it is satisfied that:</p>
    <blockquote>“... it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution.”</blockquote>
    <p>This decision follows input from relevant professionals, the young person’s views, and the voice of the family.</p>

    <p>EOTAS is always considered a last resort, used only when all other school-based options and support have been explored and found unsuitable.</p>

    <h2>How to Access EOTAS in Cornwall</h2><img src="handmeadow.png" alt="" style="width: 95px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <p>To access EOTAS in Cornwall:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your child must have an EHCP.</li>
      <li>Professionals and family must provide clear evidence that no suitable educational institution can meet their needs.</li>
      <li>Cornwall Council’s SEND team will assess whether EOTAS is appropriate.</li>
      <li>If agreed, a dedicated EOTAS coordinator will help develop a bespoke education package that meets the outcomes in the child’s EHCP.</li>
      <li>This may include completing an EOTAS Budget Proposal form to outline the plan and costings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find more information on the Cornwall Local Offer website or contact your child’s SEND caseworker directly.</p>

    <h2>What might an EOTAS package include?</h2><img src="Book.jpg" alt="" style="width: 95px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <p>A full-time EOTAS package can be up to <strong>25 hours per week during term time</strong> and may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1:1 tuition</li>
      <li>Online learning</li>
      <li>Life skills and well-being sessions</li>
      <li>Mentoring and emotional support</li>
      <li>Therapeutic or SEMH interventions</li>
      <li>Vocational training or off-site learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At Meadow Pathways, we work closely with families and the Local Authority to design provision that is meaningful, engaging, and rooted in well-being.</p>

    <h2>EOTAS at Meadow Pathways</h2><img src="arrow.png" alt="" style="width: 95px; margin-right: 10px;">
    <p>We believe every young person deserves the right to learn in a space that nurtures their strengths and supports their needs. Through our EOTAS provision, we offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experienced mentors and qualified tutors</li>
      <li>Tailored emotional and therapeutic support</li>
      <li>Creative, outdoor and vocational opportunities</li>
      <li>Guidance and advocacy for families</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our approach is grounded in the belief that no journey is the same — and that with the right path and compassionate guidance, every young person can flourish.</p>
