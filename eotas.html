    <h1>Education Other Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>

    <p>
      Meadow Pathways provides bespoke education and wellbeing support for children and young people who are unable to attend mainstream or special school. Our EOTAS provision is tailored to each learner‚Äôs strengths, interests, and needs, integrating therapeutic practice with meaningful learning experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      We meet children where they are. Whether a young person is facing emotional barriers, past trauma, or unmet needs, we work collaboratively with families, schools, and professionals to create a safe, stable, and achievable pathway back into learning and life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach is relational, flexible, and trauma-informed. We offer nurturing environments, consistent routines, and activities that build confidence, regulation, and readiness for learning.
    </p>

    <h2>What we offer</h2>
    <p>
      Every plan is bespoke and can include a blend of education, therapeutic input, and real-world skills:

    <h2>EOTAS guidance (overview)</h2>
    <p>
      EOTAS describes arrangements where a local authority agrees that education will be provided somewhere other than a school or post‚Äë16 institution, when it would be inappropriate for provision to be made there. Decisions are made on an individual basis and should be supported by evidence that a school or college cannot meet the child or young person‚Äôs needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Schools and colleges remain the default route for most learners, and they can deliver flexible programmes across on‚Äësite and off‚Äësite settings. Where these avenues have been explored and are not appropriate, EOTAS may be considered as part of an EHCP process and reviewed regularly to ensure needs are met and outcomes are pursued.
    </p>

    <h3>Funding and scope</h3>
    <p>
      An EOTAS package should deliver the educational requirements identified in the EHCP. If elements cannot be delivered, the plan may need to be reviewed. Funding should be used for education and the support required to access it; it is monitored to ensure effective and fair use of public funds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of items typically not covered include household bills, clothing, non‚Äëeducational therapies, or costs not required to access provision. Transport and meals may be considered where eligibility applies and where necessary for attendance.
    </p>

    <h2>How we work with families and professionals</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritise clear communication, safe practice, and joined‚Äëup working. Provision plans are co‚Äëcreated with families and professionals, reviewed regularly, and adjusted as needs evolve. Our goal is stable progress, growing confidence, and meaningful next steps for every learner.
