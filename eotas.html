      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>EOTAS</strong> stands for <em>Education Otherwise Than At School</em>. It is a specialised educational provision arranged by the Local Authority for children and young people with an <strong>Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)</strong> whose needs cannot be met within a traditional school environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education</strong>, we offer EOTAS packages that are thoughtful, creative, and tailored to the individual. Our provision supports children across <strong>Cornwall</strong>, creating personalised paths to learning, well-being, and growth.
      </p>

      style="width: 24px; margin-right: 8px;">
      </h3>
      <p>
        EOTAS is made possible by <strong>Section 61 of the Children and Families Act 2014</strong>. Cornwall Council can approve education outside of school when:
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 20px;">“... it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution.”</blockquote>
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #356859; display: flex; align-items: center;">
        style="width: 24px; margin-right: 8px;"> How is it different from Elective Home Education?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Elective Home Education is a parent-led choice and removes the Local Authority's duty to provide the EHCP provision. In contrast, EOTAS is a Local Authority decision that education should take place outside school — but it still requires the LA to ensure all EHCP provision is delivered.
