    <h1>What is EOTAS?</h1>
    <img src="arrow.png" alt="Arrow Icon" style="width: 30px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <p><strong>EOTAS</strong> stands for <em>Education Otherwise Than At School</em>. It is a specialised educational provision arranged by the Local Authority for children and young people with an <strong>Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)</strong> whose needs cannot be met within a traditional school environment.</p>

    <img src="Book.jpg" alt="Book Icon" style="width: 30px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <p>EOTAS packages can include up to <strong>25 hours per week during term time</strong>. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-to-one tuition</li>
      <li>Online or home-based learning</li>
      <li>Life skills development</li>
      <li>Mentoring and therapeutic support</li>
      <li>Creative or vocational education</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At Meadow Pathways, we believe in personalised learning journeys guided with care, patience, and understanding. Our approach focuses on empowering children and young people to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, tailoring the learning experience to their unique needs and aspirations.</p>

    <p><strong>Our EOTAS provision emphasizes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building confidence and resilience</li>
      <li>Encouraging creativity and independent thinking</li>
      <li>Providing therapeutic interventions where needed</li>
      <li>Creating a supportive and safe learning environment</li>
      <li>Fostering positive relationships between educators, learners, and families</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We work closely with families, local authorities, and other professionals to design and deliver bespoke EOTAS packages that meet statutory requirements and, most importantly, the needs of the child or young person. Every individual deserves the opportunity to succeed, and we are here to help them find their path.</p>
