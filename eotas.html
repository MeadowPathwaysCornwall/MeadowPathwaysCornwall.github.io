    <h1>Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>
    <p>
      Meadow Pathways Cornwall specialises in providing bespoke Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS) packages for children and young people who are unable to access mainstream education due to a variety of reasons, including neurodivergence, trauma, emotional-based school non-attendance (EBSNA), bereavement, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our EOTAS provision is designed to be flexible and tailored to each learner’s unique needs, focusing on building confidence, resilience, and a love for learning in a safe, supportive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work closely with local authorities, families, and a range of specialist support services to develop and implement personalised education plans that address not only academic needs but also emotional and social well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach includes therapeutic education on-site, outreach learning within the community, and creative programmes that engage learners in meaningful and relevant ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand the importance of collaboration, and our team regularly liaises with educational psychologists, social workers, and other professionals to ensure multi-agency support is coordinated effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
