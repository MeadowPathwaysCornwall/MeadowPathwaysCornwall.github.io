    <h1 id="eotas-title">🌱 Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>
    <p>There are some circumstances where children and young people with special educational needs cannot be educated in a mainstream school setting. This may be because a placement has broken down, is at risk of breaking down due to the complexity of needs, or because the provision required cannot be delivered within a school. 🏫➡️🏡</p>

    <p>The <strong>SEND Code of Practice (para 10.39)</strong> states:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>“Local authorities must make arrangements where, for any reason, a child of compulsory school age would not otherwise receive suitable education. Suitable education means efficient education suitable to a child or young person’s age, ability and aptitude, and to any special educational needs they may have. This education must be full time, unless the local authority determines that, for reasons relating to the physical or mental health of the child, a reduced level of education would be in the child’s best interests.”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can read more about local authorities’ duties to provide <strong>Alternative Provision</strong> through your local authority’s <em>Local Offer</em>. 🔍</p>

    <h2>🌿 Our EOTAS Offer at Meadow Pathways</h2>
    <p><strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> provides bespoke EOTAS provision across Cornwall. Our offer places wellbeing at the heart of learning, integrating therapeutic support with personalised education. We work closely with families and partner agencies to plan learning that supports emotional safety, builds confidence, and re‑engages young people with purposeful learning. 🤝🌈</p>

    <h2>👧 Who we support</h2>
    <p>We support children and young people who cannot attend mainstream school for reasons such as SEMH needs, SEND, school avoidance, or where a tailored approach is needed to re‑engage a learner with education. Our approach is flexible and responsive to each learner’s strengths, needs and interests. 🌟</p>

    <h2>🧭 How we work</h2>
    <p>Our work begins with listening. We gather information from families, schools and professionals, informing the development of bespoke learning packages which support the child's/young person's needs, interests and future aspirations. Sessions blend therapeutic approaches with curriculum linked activities so that learning is meaningful and transferable. Our approach uses small group work, one‑to‑one or two-to-one mentoring, and community based activities to build skills, confidence and positive connections. 🎒🧠</p>
