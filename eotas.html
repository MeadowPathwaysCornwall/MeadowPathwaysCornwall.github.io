      <p>
        There are some circumstances where children and young people with special educational needs cannot be educated in a main stream school setting. This may be because a placement has broken down, is at risk of breaking down due to the complexity of needs, or because the provision required cannot be delivered within a school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>SEND Code of Practice (para 10.39)</strong> states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>
          ‚ÄúLocal authorities must make arrangements where, for any reason, a child of compulsory school age would not otherwise receive suitable education. Suitable education means efficient education suitable to a child or young person‚Äôs age, ability and aptitude, and to any special educational needs they may have. This education must be full time, unless the local authority determines that, for reasons relating to the physical or mental health of the child, a reduced level of education would be in the child‚Äôs best interests.‚Äù
        </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You can read more about local authorities‚Äô duties to provide <strong>Alternative Provision</strong> through your local authority‚Äôs <em>Local Offer</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your child or young person is finding it challenging to access their current setting, and an <strong>Education, Health and Care (EHCP)</strong> plan is in place or being secured, you may wish to consider an <strong>EOTAS request</strong> to ensure that the special educational provision outlined in the plan can be delivered in a setting other than a school.
      </p>

      <h2>üí° What is EOTAS?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Education Otherwise Than At School</strong> means the education or special educational provision of children or young people outside of a formal educational setting. It can only be agreed in conjunction with the local authority as part of an EHC needs assessment, a reassessment of needs, or through the EHCP annual review process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A child or young person accessing EOTAS is not on roll at a school or post‚Äë16 setting. Provision may take place at home or in another non‚Äëregistered setting, depending on the child‚Äôs needs and the agreed plan.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Online or virtual learning</li>
        <li>Home tuition</li>
        <li>Tuition centres or specialist learning hubs</li>
        <li>Hospital schooling</li>
        <li>Therapeutic input: speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, counselling, or play therapy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All such provision should be detailed in <strong>Section F of the EHCP</strong>, which the local authority is then responsible for securing and funding.
      </p>

      <h2>üåø Our EOTAS Offer at Meadow Pathways</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> provides bespoke EOTAS provision across Cornwall. Our offer places wellbeing at the heart of learning, integrating therapeutic support with personalised education. We work closely with families and partner agencies to plan learning that supports emotional safety, builds confidence, and re‚Äëengages young people with purposeful learning.
      </p>

      <h2>üëß Who we support</h2>
      <p>
        We support children and young people who cannot attend mainstream school for reasons such as SEMH needs, SEND, school avoidance, or where a tailored approach is needed to re‚Äëengage a learner with education. Our approach is flexible and responsive to each learner‚Äôs strengths, needs and interests.
      </p>

      <h2>üß≠ How we work</h2>
      <p>
        Our work begins with listening. We gather information from families, schools and professionals, informing the development of bespoke learning packages which support the child's/young person's needs, interests and furture aspirations. Sessions blend therapeutic approaches with curriculum linked activities so that learning is meaningful and transferable. Our approach uses small group work, one‚Äëto‚Äëone or two-to-one mentoring, and community based activities to build skills, confidence and positive connections.
      </p>
