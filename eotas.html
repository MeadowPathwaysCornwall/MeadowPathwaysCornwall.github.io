    <h1>Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>
    <p>
      Meadow Pathways Cornwall specialises in providing bespoke Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS) packages for children and young people who are unable to access mainstream education due to a variety of reasons, including neurodivergence, trauma, emotional-based school non-attendance (EBSNA), bereavement, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our EOTAS provision is designed to be flexible and tailored to each learner’s unique needs, focusing on building confidence, resilience, and a love for learning in a safe, supportive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work closely with local authorities, families, and a range of specialist support services to develop and implement personalised education plans that address not only academic needs but also emotional and social well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach includes therapeutic education on-site, outreach learning within the community, and creative programmes that engage learners in meaningful and relevant ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand the importance of collaboration, and our team regularly liaises with educational psychologists, social workers, and other professionals to ensure multi-agency support is coordinated effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information or to discuss how our EOTAS services can support your child or young person, please contact us via the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.

  <h1>EOTAS Guidance (Cornwall Council)</h1>
  <p><strong>Cornwall Council says:</strong> EOTAS operates under the Children and Families Act 2014.</p>

  <p>EOTAS is made possible by Section 61 of the Children and Families Act 2014. Under Section 61, local authorities have the power to consent to a child or young person with SEN being educated somewhere other than a school or post-16 institution (typically at home), but only where the authority is satisfied that “it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution or at such a place”.</p>

  <h2>When can EOTAS be considered?</h2>
  <p>EOTAS can be considered when professionals and parents/carers have evidenced that there is no appropriate educational institution available that can meet the child or young person’s special educational needs.</p>

  <p>It is widely accepted that schools and colleges are best placed to deliver educational and broader socio-educational programs. Schools and colleges can deliver educational provision in many different ways, using on-site and off-site programs and adapting their curriculum offers in line with young people’s needs.</p>

  <p>It would be the local authority’s expectation that all avenues of other educational provision are explored before EOTAS will be considered as an educational route (in line with Section 100 of the Children and Families Act 2014).</p>

  <h2>What can and cannot be included in an EOTAS package?</h2>
  <p>An EOTAS package endeavours to provide the educational requirements as identified in the young person’s EHCP. If some aspects of the EHCP cannot be delivered through an EOTAS package, then a review would need to take place.</p>

  <p><strong>Below are areas where EOTAS funding may not be used:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support and funding outside term time</li>
    <li>Household utility bills</li>
    <li>Meals (except for eligible free school meals, which may be funded)</li>
    <li>Clothing</li>
    <li>Therapies not identified as educational requirements</li>
    <li>Additional transport costs beyond what is needed to access provision</li>
    <li>Additional adult support not needed for education access</li>
    <li>Training or professional development of PAs/TAs</li>
    <li>Additional technologies not required for appropriate learning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As with all funding, the local authority has a duty to ensure effective and
