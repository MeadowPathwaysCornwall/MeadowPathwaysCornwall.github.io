      <h1>Welcome to EOTAS at Meadow Pathways</h1>
      <p>Guiding Individual Journeys with Care and Purpose</p>

      <h2>🌱 Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h2>
      <p>Some children and young people with special educational needs cannot be educated in a mainstream school setting. This may be due to a placement breakdown, the complexity of needs, or because the provision required cannot be delivered within a school. 🏫➡️🏡</p>

      <p>The SEND Code of Practice (para 10.39) states: Local authorities must make arrangements where, for any reason, a child of compulsory school age would not otherwise receive suitable education. Suitable education means efficient education suitable to a child or young person’s age, ability and aptitude, and to any special educational needs they may have. This education must be full time, unless the local authority determines a reduced level is in the child’s best interests.</p>

      <p>You can read more about local authorities’ duties through your local authority’s Local Offer. 🔍</p>

      <p>If your child or young person is finding it challenging to access their current setting, and an <strong>Education, Health and Care (EHCP) plan</strong> is in place or being secured, you may wish to consider an EOTAS request to ensure the provision outlined in the plan can be delivered outside of a school. 📄🤝</p>

      <h2>💡 What is EOTAS?</h2>
      <p>Education Otherwise Than At School refers to education or special educational provision outside of a formal educational setting. It can only be agreed with the local authority as part of an EHC needs assessment, reassessment, or EHCP annual review.</p>
      <p>Children accessing EOTAS are not on roll at a school or post-16 setting. Provision may occur at home or in another non-registered setting, depending on the child’s needs. 🏠📚</p>

      <h3>Examples of EOTAS provision</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💻 Online or virtual learning</li>
        <li>🏠 Home tuition</li>
        <li>🏫 Tuition centres or specialist learning hubs</li>
        <li>🏥 Hospital schooling</li>
        <li>💬 Therapeutic input: speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, counselling, or play therapy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All provision should be detailed in Section F of the EHCP, which the local authority is responsible for securing and funding. 📝</p>
