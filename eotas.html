    <p>
      Meadow Pathways provides bespoke education and wellbeing support for children and young people who are unable to attend mainstream or specialist provision. Our EOTAS provision is tailored to each learner’s strengths, interests, and needs, integrating therapeutic practice with meaningful learning experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We meet children where they are. Whether a young person is facing emotional barriers, past trauma, or unmet needs, we work collaboratively with families, schools, and professionals to create a safe, stable, and achievable pathway back into learning and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach is relational, flexible, and trauma-informed. We offer nurturing environments, consistent routines, and activities that build confidence, regulation, and readiness for learning.

    <h2>EOTAS guidance</h2>
    <p>
      EOTAS describes arrangements where a local authority agrees that education will be provided somewhere other than a school or post‑16 institution, when it would be inappropriate for provision to be made there. Decisions are made on an individual basis and should be supported by evidence that a school or college cannot meet the child or young person’s needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schools and colleges remain the default route for most learners, and they can deliver flexible programmes across on‑site and off‑site settings. Where these avenues have been explored and are not appropriate, EOTAS may be considered as part of an EHCP process and reviewed regularly to ensure needs are met and outcomes are pursued.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with families and professionals</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritise clear communication, safe practice, and joined‑up working. Provision plans are co‑created with families and professionals, reviewed regularly, and adjusted as needs evolve. Our goal is stable progress, growing confidence, and meaningful next steps for every learner.
