      <h1 id="eotas-title" class="accent">Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>
      <p>There are some circumstances where children and young people with special educational needs cannot be educated in a formal educational setting. This may be because a placement has broken down, is at risk of breaking down due to the complexity of needs, or because the provision required cannot be delivered within a school setting.</p>

      <p>The <strong>SEND Code of Practice (para 10.39)</strong> states that:</p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúLocal authorities must make arrangements where, for any reason, a child of compulsory school age would not otherwise receive suitable education. Suitable education means efficient education suitable to a child or young person‚Äôs age, ability and aptitude, and to any special educational needs they may have. This education must be full time, unless the local authority determines that, for reasons relating to the physical or mental health of the child, a reduced level of education would be in the child‚Äôs best interests.‚Äù
      </blockquote>

      <p>You can read more about local authorities‚Äô duties to provide <strong>Alternative Provision</strong> through your local authority‚Äôs <em>Local Offer</em>.</p>

      <p>If your child or young person is struggling to access their current setting, and an <strong>Education, Health and Care (EHC)</strong> plan is in place or being secured, you may wish to consider an <strong>EOTAS request</strong> to ensure that the special educational provision outlined in the plan can be delivered in a setting other than a school.</p>

      <h2 class="accent">What is EOTAS?</h2>
      <p><strong>Education Otherwise Than At School</strong> means the education or special educational provision of children or young people outside of a formal educational setting. It can only be agreed in conjunction with the local authority as part of an EHC needs assessment, a reassessment of needs, or through the EHCP annual review process.</p>

      <p>A child or young person accessing EOTAS is not on roll at a school or post-16 institution. Provision may take place at home or in another non-registered setting, depending on the child‚Äôs needs and agreed plan.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>üíª Online or virtual learning</li>
        <li>üè† Home tuition</li>
        <li>üè´ Tuition centres or specialist learning hubs</li>
        <li>üè• Hospital schooling</li>
        <li>üí¨ Therapeutic input such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, counselling, or play therapy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All such provision should be detailed in <strong>Section F of the EHCP</strong>, which the local authority is then responsible for securing and funding.</p>

      <h2 class="accent">Our EOTAS Offer at Meadow Pathways</h2>
      <p><strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> provides bespoke Education Otherwise Than At School provision across Cornwall.
