  <h1>EOTAS Guidance (Cornwall Council)</h1>
  <p><strong>Cornwall Council says:</strong> EOTAS operates under the Children and Families Act 2014.</p>

  <p>EOTAS is made possible by Section 61 of the Children and Families Act 2014. Under Section 61, local authorities have the power to consent to a child or young person with SEN being educated somewhere other than a school or post-16 institution (typically at home), but only where the authority is satisfied that “it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution or at such a place”.</p>

  <h2>When can EOTAS be considered?</h2>
  <p>EOTAS can be considered when professionals and parents/carers have evidenced that there is no appropriate educational institution available that can meet the child or young person’s special educational needs.</p>

  <p>It is widely accepted that schools and colleges are best placed to deliver educational and broader socio-educational programmes. Schools and colleges can deliver educational provision in many different ways, using on-site and off-site programmes and adapting their curriculum offers in line with young people’s needs.</p>

  <p>It would be the local authority’s expectation that all avenues of other educational provision are explored before EOTAS will be considered as an educational route (in line with Section 100 of the Children and Families Act 2014).</p>

  <h2>What can and cannot be included in an EOTAS package?</h2>
  <p>An EOTAS package endeavours to provide the educational requirements as identified in the young person’s EHCP. If some aspects of the EHCP cannot be delivered through an EOTAS package, then a review would need to take place.</p>

  <p><strong>Below are areas where EOTAS funding may not be used:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support and funding outside term time</li>
    <li>Household utility bills</li>
    <li>Meals (except for eligible free school meals, which may be funded)</li>
    <li>Clothing</li>
    <li>Therapies not identified as educational requirements</li>
    <li>Additional transport costs beyond what is needed to access provision</li>
    <li>Additional adult support not needed for education access</li>
    <li>Training or professional development of PAs/TAs</li>
    <li>Additional technologies not required for appropriate learning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As with all funding, the local authority has a duty to ensure effective and fair use of public funds. Therefore, how funding is used for EOTAS packages needs to be closely monitored.</p>

  <h2>EOTAS and SEND Support</h2>
  <p>The Government’s view is that the best place for children to receive education is in an appropriate educational setting (mainstream or special schools) with their peers, where each pupil has access to a full range of learning and development experiences.</p>

  <p>If a child or young person has SEND but does not have an EHCP and their educational placement is breaking down, parents/carers should consider discussing a SEND support review with the school or setting.</p>

  <p>If things do not improve, a request could be made to the local authority for an EHC needs assessment. This may help identify the child’s or young person’s needs and the support they require to continue their education—possibly within their current setting, with the right support.</p>
