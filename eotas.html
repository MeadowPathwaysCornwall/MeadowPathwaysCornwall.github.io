   <h1>🌱 Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>

<p>
  There are some circumstances where children and young people with special educational needs cannot be educated in a formal educational setting. This may be because a placement has broken down, is at risk of breaking down due to the complexity of needs, or because the provision required cannot be delivered within a school setting.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>SEND Code of Practice (para 10.39)</strong> states that:<br>
  <em>
    “Local authorities must make arrangements where, for any reason, a child of compulsory school age would not otherwise receive suitable education. Suitable education means efficient education suitable to a child or young person’s age, ability and aptitude, and to any special educational needs they may have. This education must be full time, unless the local authority determines that, for reasons relating to the physical or mental health of the child, a reduced level of education would be in the child’s best interests.”
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  You can read more about local authorities’ duties to provide <strong>Alternative Provision</strong> through your local authority’s <em>Local Offer</em>.
</p>

<p>
  If your child or young person is struggling to access their current setting, and an <strong>Education, Health and Care (EHC)</strong> plan is in place or being secured, you may wish to consider an <strong>EOTAS request</strong> to ensure that the special educational provision outlined in the plan can be delivered in a setting other than a school.
</p>

<h2>💡 What is EOTAS?</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Education Otherwise Than At School</strong> means the education or special educational provision of children or young people outside of a formal educational setting. It can only be agreed in conjunction with the local authority as part of an EHC needs assessment, a reassessment of needs, or through the EHCP annual review process.
</p>

<p>
  A child or young person accessing EOTAS is not on roll at a school or post-16 institution. Provision may take place at home or in another non-registered setting, depending on the child’s needs and agreed plan.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>💻 Online or virtual learning</li>
  <li>🏠 Home tuition</li>
  <li>🏫 Tuition centres or specialist learning hubs</li>
  <li>🏥 Hospital schooling</li>
  <li>💬 Therapeutic input such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, counselling, or play therapy</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All such provision should be detailed in <strong>Section F of the EHCP</strong>, which the local authority is then responsible for securing and funding.
</p>

<h2>🌿 Our EOTAS Offer at Meadow Pathways</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> provides bespoke Education Otherwise Than At School provision across Cornwall. Our EOTAS offer places wellbeing at the heart of learning and integrates therapeutic support with personalised education. We work closely with families and partner agencies to plan learning that supports emotional safety, builds confidence, and re-engages young people with purposeful learning.
</p>

<h2>👧 Who We Support</h2>
<p>
  We support children and young people who cannot attend mainstream school for reasons such as social, emotional and mental health needs, special educational needs, school avoidance, or where a tailored approach is needed to re-engage a learner with education. Our approach is flexible and responsive to each learner’s strengths, needs and interests.
</p>

<h2>🧭 How We Work</h2>
<p>
  Our work begins with listening. We gather information from families, schools and professionals, then use diagnostic assessments and literacy and numeracy profiling to design targeted learning. Sessions blend therapeutic practice with curriculum-linked activities so that learning is meaningful and transferable. We use small group work, one-to-one mentoring, and community-based activities to build skills, confidence and positive connections.
</p>

<h2>🎯 What We Offer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 <strong>Mentoring and Advocacy:</strong> Building trust and self-belief through consistent relational support and alternative provisions.</li>
  <li>📚 <strong>Tailored Learning Packages:</strong> Flexible academic pathways matched to each learner’s pace and interests.</li>
  <li>🛠 <strong>Life Skills and Independence Training:</strong> Practical preparation for adulthood, including functional skills and community engagement.</li>
  <li>🧮 <strong>Diagnostic Assessments:</strong> Literacy and numeracy profiling to inform targeted intervention.</li>
  <li>💛 <strong>SEMH Interventions:</strong> Trauma-informed strategies to support emotional regulation and resilience.</li>
  <li>🎨 <strong>Wellbeing and PSHE Packages:</strong> Creative therapeutic sessions that promote self-awareness, relationships and personal growth.</li>
  <li>🔄 <strong>Transitional Services:</strong> Carefully planned reintegration or onward pathways supported by multi-agency collaboration.</li>
  <li>🧠 <strong>Therapeutic and Curriculum-Linked Activities:</strong> Engaging activities tailored to each learner’s interests, including nature-based bush craft, walking, fitness, water-based activities, fishing, climbing, cooking, play, biking and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We offer a bespoke provision that reflects each child’s individual interests. Activities are linked to the curriculum and supported by ASDAN qualifications and AQA Unit Awards. This ensures young people can build recognised achievements while engaging in meaningful learning.
</p>

<h2>🌼 Sample Activities</h2>
<p>
  Nature-based bush craft, walking, fitness, water-based activities, fishing, climbing, cooking, play, biking and supported therapeutic sessions. Activities are chosen with each learner to reflect their interests and provide opportunities for success, wellbeing and skills development.
