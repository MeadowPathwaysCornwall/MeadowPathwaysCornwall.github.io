    <h1>Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS)</h1>
    <p>
      Cornwall Council says: EOTAS operates under the Children and Families Act 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOTAS is made possible by section 61 of the Children and Families Act 2014. Under section 61, local authorities have the power to consent to a child or young person with SEN being educated somewhere other than a school or post-16 institution (typically at home), but only where the authority is satisfied that “…it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution or at such a place”.
    </p>
    <h2>WHEN can EOTAS be considered?</h2>
    <p>
      EOTAS can be considered when professionals and parents/carers have evidenced that there is no appropriate educational institution available that can meet the child or young person’s special educational needs. It is widely accepted that schools and colleges are best placed to deliver educational and broader socio-educational programs. Schools and colleges can deliver educational provision in many different ways, using on-site and off-site programs and adapting their curriculum offers in line with young peoples’ needs. It would be the local authority’s expectation that all avenues of other educational provision have been explored before EOTAS is agreed.
