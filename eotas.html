      <h2>Education Other Than At School</h2>

      <p>
        Meadow Pathways provides bespoke Education Other Than At School provision across Cornwall. Our EOTAS offer places wellbeing at the centre of learning and matches therapeutic support with personalised education. We work closely with families and partner agencies to plan learning that supports emotional safety, builds confidence, and reengages young people with purposeful learning.
      </p>

      <h3>Who we support</h3>
      <p>
        We support children and young people who cannot attend mainstream school for reasons such as social emotional and mental health needs special educational needs school avoidance or where a tailored approach is needed to reengage a learner with education. Our approach is flexible and responsive to each learner's strengths needs and interests.
      </p>

      <h3>How we work</h3>
      <p>
        Our work begins with listening. We gather information from families schools and professionals then use diagnostic assessments and literacy and numeracy profiling to design targeted learning. Sessions blend therapeutic practice with curriculum linked activities so that learning is meaningful and transferable. We use small group work one to one mentoring and community based activities to build skills confidence and positive connections.
