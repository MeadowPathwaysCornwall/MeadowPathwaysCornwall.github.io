    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Meadow Pathways provides trauma informed, person‑centred education and wellbeing support for children and young people across Cornwall. We specialise in supporting those with SEND, SEMH, Emotionally Based School Non Attendance (EBSNA), bereavement, and the effects of educational trauma. Our ethos is rooted in safety, trust, creativity, and belonging.</p>
    <p>We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, no matter their background or previous experiences. Our holistic approach blends therapeutic practice with flexible, creative education that meets learners where they are — emotionally, socially, and academically.</p>
    <p>Working in partnership with families, schools, and local authorities, we design individualised programmes that nurture confidence, rebuild relationships with learning, and promote emotional resilience. Whether through outdoor exploration, creative arts, or one‑to‑one mentoring, our work empowers children and young people to rediscover their strengths and find joy in learning.</p>
    <p>At Meadow Pathways, we recognise that healing and education go hand in hand. By fostering an environment where every voice is valued and every journey respected, we help our learners grow not only in knowledge but in wellbeing, independence, and self‑belief.</p>
