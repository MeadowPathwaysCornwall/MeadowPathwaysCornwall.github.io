      <h3>🌿 Michelle Pascoe</h3>
      <p>
        Michelle is a founding director and Lead Therapist for Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall.  
        She supports children and young people across the community who experience Special Educational Needs (SEN), 
        Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs, educational trauma, bereavement, and Emotionally Based School Non‑Attendance (EBSNA). 
        With over 20 years of experience, Michelle is a qualified counsellor and play therapist. She spent more than a decade 
        in an independent SEN school, beginning as a HLTA and progressing to senior leadership, where she served as Designated 
        Safeguarding Lead for over seven years. She also dedicated 10 years to one of Cornwall’s only accredited Nurture Groups, 
        embedding a trauma‑informed approach into every aspect of her practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Michelle works in a trauma‑informed, person‑centred way, focusing on building trust and emotional safety with families, 
        schools, and professionals. Her approach combines therapeutic insight with creativity and compassion, helping children 
        rediscover their confidence, curiosity, and sense of belonging. Beyond her professional role, Michelle enjoys exploring 
        Cornwall’s coastal paths and woodlands with her two dogs, Pixie and Ivey 🐾🌊🌲. She brings warmth, creativity, 
        and a deep commitment to fostering relationships that support both healing and learning, ensuring that every child feels 
        seen, heard, and valued. ✨

      <h3>🌸 Zoe Waitz</h3>
      <p>
        Zoe Waitz is a founding director of Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall, an organisation built on 
        the belief that every child deserves to feel safe, seen, and supported. Meadow Pathways offers inclusive, 
        therapeutic education for children and young people with SEND and SEMH needs, placing wellbeing at the centre 
        of everything it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zoe’s leadership is rooted in genuine care. She understands that meaningful change happens not just through 
        policies and plans, but through everyday moments of connection with learners, families, and the dedicated staff 
        who walk alongside them. Her approach weaves compassion into strategic decisions, ensuring that every layer 
        of the organisation reflects the values it stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zoe began her career as a teaching assistant, driven by a passion for outdoor learning and physical education. 
        She qualified as a PE teacher and quickly recognised the value of working closely with families and other specialists 
        to support each young person. This led to pastoral and senior leadership in specialist education, deepening her commitment 
        to inclusive, wellbeing‑focused practice. She brings deep insight into the emotional and practical realities faced 
        by vulnerable learners and the teams who support them. That lived understanding now shapes every aspect of Meadow Pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nature is a constant thread in Zoe’s work. As a former outdoor education instructor, she sees the outdoors not just as a backdrop, 
        but as a space that offers something different to everyone. Whether it’s a walk along the Cornish coast, a forest school session, 
        or cooking with foraged ingredients, Zoe believes that nature offers regulation, joy, and connection for young people, staff, and 
        the wider community. 🌊🌲🍳 It’s this blend of care, creativity, and purpose that makes Meadow Pathways feel not just like a service, 
        but a place to belong.
