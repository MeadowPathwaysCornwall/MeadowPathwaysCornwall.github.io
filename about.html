    <h2>Zoe Waitz</h2>
    <p>
  Zoe is a qualified teacher with over 10 years’ experience working in special education. 
  She has supported children and young people who find mainstream settings challenging, 
  including those with anxiety, school avoidance (EBSNA), neurodiversity, and trauma-related needs. 
  Zoe is all about a child-centred approach—meeting each young person where they are and helping them grow in confidence, 
  re-engage with learning, and find their own path. She’s passionate about using the outdoors and nature-based learning 
  to build resilience, emotional wellbeing, and a genuine love of learning. 
  Outside of work, Zoe can usually be found knee-deep in the veg patch, chatting to her chickens, 
  or off exploring Cornwall’s wild corners with her family—ideally ending up at a good cafe.
