    <h1>About Meadow Pathways Cornwall</h1>
    <p>
      Meadow Pathways was founded with a commitment to providing a safe, inclusive and nurturing environment for children and young people in Cornwall who require education outside of mainstream school settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our multi-disciplinary team brings together experienced teachers, SEN specialists, mental health practitioners, and family support workers. We work collaboratively with local authorities, schools, and families to design bespoke EOTAS packages that meet the unique needs of each individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in the power of relationship-based practice, trauma-informed approaches, and building resilience. Every childâ€™s journey is different, and we are here to support them every step of the way.
