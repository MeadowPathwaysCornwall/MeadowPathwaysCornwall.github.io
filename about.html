    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Our vision is to create an inclusive educational centre that provides a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for children and young people who are facing Social, Emotional, and Mental Health (SEMH) challenges, as well as Special Educational Needs (SEN)...</p>
    <!-- Continue withMeadow Pathways Well-being and Education is a developing, independent EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) provision designed to support children and young people with Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs and a wide range of neurodiversity. Founded by experienced SEN professionals with over 30 years’ combined experience in both mainstream and specialist settings, we are committed to providing a flexible, therapeutic, and relationship-based approach to learning.

Who We Are
Michelle Pascoe and Zoe Waitz are the co-founders of Meadow Pathways. Between them, they bring extensive leadership experience from both mainstream and independent SEMH schools, specialising in safeguarding, curriculum design, pastoral support, and multi-agency working. Both Michelle and Zoe are deeply rooted in Cornwall and have a long-standing commitment to supporting vulnerable children and young people across the county.

Their professional practice is underpinned by a deep understanding of trauma-informed care, therapeutic learning environments, and the vital role of trusted relationships in re-engaging learners. Michelle and Zoe work closely with families, schools, and local authorities to create packages that are not only educationally sound, but emotionally supportive and highly personalised.

What sets them apart is their ability to blend education, care, and therapeutic approaches in a truly bespoke offer — delivered with warmth, professionalism, and a genuine belief in every young person’s potential.

What We Offer
Meadow Pathways provides a bespoke, therapeutic EOTAS package that includes:

1:1 and small group teaching tailored to individual learning needs

SEMH interventions and well-being sessions

Life skills and mentoring

PSHE bespoke packages

Transition planning and support

Therapeutic enrichment activities in the community and natural environments

Our programmes are carefully designed in collaboration with families, local authorities, and other professionals to ensure each child’s education plan is fully personalised, holistic, and meaningful. Whether in the home, community, or other suitable environments, we deliver high-quality learning that supports both academic and emotional growth.

At Meadow Pathways, we believe that with the right support, every young person can achieve and flourish — and we are here to walk alongside them every step of the way.  -->
