      <p>Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education is a developing, independent EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) provision designed to support children and young people with Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs and a wide range of neurodiversity. Founded by experienced SEN professionals with over 30 years’ combined experience in both mainstream and specialist settings, we are committed to providing a flexible, therapeutic, and relationship-based approach to learning.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Michelle Pascoe and Zoe [Surname] are the co-founders of Meadow Pathways. Between them, they bring extensive leadership experience from both mainstream and independent SEMH schools, specialising in safeguarding, curriculum design, pastoral support, and multi-agency working. Both Michelle and Zoe are deeply rooted in Cornwall and have a long-standing commitment to supporting vulnerable children and young people across the county.</p>
      <p>Their professional practice is underpinned by a deep understanding of trauma-informed care, therapeutic learning environments, and the vital role of trusted relationships in re-engaging learners. Michelle and Zoe work closely with families, schools, and local authorities to create packages that are not only educationally sound, but emotionally supportive and highly personalised.</p>
