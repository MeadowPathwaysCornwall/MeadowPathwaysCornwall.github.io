    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="arrow-paragraph">
      Meadow Pathways Cornwall is dedicated to providing inclusive, nurturing, and bespoke education for all young people. Meadow Pathways Well-being and Education is a developing, independent EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) provision designed to support children and young people with Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs and a wide range of neurodiversity.
    </p>
    <p class="arrow-paragraph">
      Founded by experienced SEN professionals with over 30 years’ combined experience in both mainstream and specialist settings, we are committed to providing a flexible, therapeutic, and relationship-based approach to learning.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p class="arrow-paragraph">
      Michelle Pascoe and Zoe Waitz are the co-founders of Meadow Pathways. Between them, they bring extensive leadership experience from both mainstream and independent SEMH schools, specialising in safeguarding, curriculum design, pastoral support, and multi-agency working. Both Michelle and Zoe are deeply rooted in Cornwall and have a long-standing commitment to supporting vulnerable children and young people across the county.
    </p>
    <p class="arrow-paragraph">
      Their professional practice is underpinned by a deep understanding of trauma-informed care, therapeutic learning environments, and the vital role of trusted relationships in re-engaging learners. Michelle and Zoe work closely with families, schools, and local authorities to create packages that are not only educationally sound, but emotionally supportive and highly personalised.
    </p>
    <p class="arrow-paragraph">
      What sets them apart is their ability to blend education, care, and therapeutic approaches in a truly bespoke offer — delivered with warmth, professionalism, and a genuine belief in every young person’s potential.
    </p>
