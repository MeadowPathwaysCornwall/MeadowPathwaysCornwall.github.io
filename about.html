        <h2>Guiding Individual Journeys with Care and Purpose</h2>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Meadow Pathways provides trauma-informed, person-centred education and wellbeing support for children and young people across Cornwall. We specialise in supporting those with SEND, SEMH, Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance (EBSNA), bereavement, and the effects of educational trauma. Our ethos is rooted in <strong>safety, trust, creativity, and belonging.</strong></p>

        <p>Working in partnership with families, schools, and local authorities, we design individualised programmes that nurture confidence, rebuild relationships with learning, and promote emotional resilience. Whether through outdoor exploration, creative arts, or one-to-one mentoring, our work empowers children and young people to rediscover their strengths and find joy in learning.</p>

        <p>At Meadow Pathways, we recognise that healing and education go hand in hand. By fostering an environment where every voice is valued and every journey respected, we help our learners grow not only in knowledge but in wellbeing, independence, and self-belief.</p>

            <h3>🌿 Michelle Pascoe</h3>
            <p><strong>Founding Director &amp; Lead Therapist</strong></p>
            <p>Michelle supports children and young people who experience Special Educational Needs (SEN), Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs, educational trauma, bereavement, and Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance (EBSNA).  
            With over 20 years of experience, Michelle is a qualified counsellor and play therapist. She spent more than a decade in an independent SEN school, beginning as a HLTA and progressing to senior leadership, serving as Designated Safeguarding Lead for over seven years.  
            She also dedicated 10 years to one of Cornwall’s only accredited Nurture Groups, embedding a trauma-informed approach into every aspect of her practice.</p>

            <h3>🌸 Zoe Waitz</h3>
            <p><strong>Founding Director</strong></p>
            <p>Zoe is a founding director of <strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong> — an organisation built on the belief that every child deserves to feel safe, seen, and supported. Meadow Pathways offers inclusive, therapeutic education for children and young people with SEND and SEMH needs, placing wellbeing at the centre of everything it does.</p>

            <p>Zoe’s leadership is rooted in genuine care. She understands that meaningful change happens not just through policies and plans, but through everyday moments of connection with learners, families, and the dedicated staff who walk alongside them. Her approach weaves compassion into strategic decisions, ensuring that every layer of the organisation reflects the values it stands for.</p>

            <p>Zoe began her career as a teaching assistant, driven by a passion for outdoor learning and physical education. She qualified as a PE teacher and quickly recognised the value of working closely with families and other specialists to support each young person. This led to pastoral and senior leadership in specialist education, deepening her commitment to inclusive, wellbeing-focused practice.</p>

            <p>Nature is a constant thread in Zoe’s work. As a former outdoor education instructor, she sees the outdoors not just as a backdrop, but as a space that offers something different to everyone. Whether it’s a walk along the Cornish coast, a forest school session, or cooking with foraged ingredients, Zoe believes that nature offers regulation, joy, and connection for young people, staff, and the wider community. 🌊🌲🍳</p>

            <p>It’s this blend of care, creativity, and purpose that makes Meadow Pathways feel not just like a service, but a place to belong.</p>
