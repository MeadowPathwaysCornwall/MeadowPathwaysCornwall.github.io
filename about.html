        <h2>About Meadow Pathways</h2>
        <h3>Guiding Individual Journeys with Care and Purpose</h3>
        <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
        <p>Meadow Pathways provides trauma informed, person-centred education and wellbeing support for children and young people across Cornwall. We specialise in supporting those with SEND, SEMH, Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance (EBSNA), bereavement, and the effects of educational trauma. Our ethos is rooted in safety, trust, creativity, and belonging.</p>

        <p>We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, no matter their background or previous experiences. Our holistic approach blends therapeutic practice with flexible, creative education that meets learners where they are emotionally, socially, and academically.</p>

        <p>Working in partnership with families, schools, and local authorities, we design individualised programmes that nurture confidence, rebuild relationships with learning, and promote emotional resilience. Whether through outdoor exploration, creative arts, or one-to-one mentoring, our work empowers children and young people to rediscover their strengths and find joy in learning.</p>
