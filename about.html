    <p>
      Michelle is a qualified counsellor and play therapist with over 20 years‚Äô experience supporting children and young people with SEN, SEMH, educational trauma, bereavement, and Emotionally Based School Non-Attendance (EBSNA).
      Her trauma-informed, person-centred approach is guided by the SPACE ethos and a deep commitment to emotional safety and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michelle‚Äôs work is flexible and creative, meeting each child at their own pace‚Äîwhether in the gym, at the beach, or in a quiet learning space to rebuild confidence and school-readiness.
      She partners closely with families, shaping support that‚Äôs warm, authentic, and genuinely responsive to each young person‚Äôs journey.
    </p>
    <p>
  Michelle enjoys walking Cornwall‚Äôs coastal paths and exploring its woodlands. She also loves to travel, especially to warmer places. But she‚Äôs just as happy out in the Cornish drizzle with her dogs, Pixie and Ivey, who never miss a chance to dive into muddy puddles or chase squirrels through the trees.
</p>

    <h2>Zoe Waitz ‚Äì Founding Director</h2>
    <p>
      Zoe‚Äôs leadership is rooted in genuine care. She understands that meaningful change happens not just through policies and plans, but through everyday moments of connection with learners, families, and the dedicated staff who walk alongside them.
      Her approach weaves compassion into strategic decisions, ensuring that every layer of the organisation reflects the values it stands for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoe began her career as a teaching assistant, driven by a passion for outdoor learning and physical education.
      She qualified as a PE teacher and quickly recognised the value of working closely with families and other specialists to support each young person.
      This led to pastoral and senior leadership in specialist education, deepening her commitment to inclusive, wellbeing-focused practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature is a constant thread in Zoe‚Äôs work. As a former outdoor education instructor, she sees the outdoors not just as a backdrop, but as a space that offers something different to everyone.
      Whether it‚Äôs a walk along the Cornish coast, a forest school session, or cooking with foraged ingredients, Zoe believes that nature offers regulation, joy, and connection for young people, staff, and the wider community.
    </p>
