          <p>
            Michelle is a founding director and the lead therapist at Meadow Pathways. A qualified counsellor and play therapist with over twenty years’ experience, she supports children and young people across the community, including those with SEN, SEMH, educational trauma, bereavement, and Emotionally Based School Non‑Attendance (EBSNA).
            Her work is trauma‑informed and person‑centred, guided by the SPACE ethos and a deep commitment to emotional safety and trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Michelle’s approach is flexible and creative, meeting each child at their own pace—whether in the gym, at the beach, or in a quiet learning space to rebuild confidence and school‑readiness.
            She partners closely with families, shaping support that’s warm, authentic, and genuinely responsive to each young person’s journey.

          <h3 class="role">Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</h3>

          <p>
            Zoe Waitz is a founding director of Meadow Pathways, an organisation built on the belief that every child deserves to feel safe, seen, and supported.
            Meadow Pathways offers inclusive, therapeutic education for children and young people with
            <abbr title="Special Educational Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr> and
            <abbr title="Social, Emotional and Mental Health">SEMH</abbr> needs, placing wellbeing at the centre of everything it does.
          </p>

          <p class="subhead">Leadership and ethos</p>
          <p>
            Zoe’s leadership is rooted in genuine care. She understands that meaningful change happens not just through policies and plans, but through everyday moments of connection with learners, families, and the dedicated staff who walk alongside them.
            Her approach weaves compassion into strategic decisions, ensuring that every layer of the organisation reflects the values it stands for.
          </p>

          <p class="subhead">Career journey</p>
          <p>
            Zoe began her career as a teaching assistant, driven by a passion for outdoor learning and physical education. She qualified as a PE teacher and quickly recognised the value of working closely with families and other specialists to support each young person.
            This led to pastoral and senior leadership in specialist education, deepening her commitment to inclusive, wellbeing‑focused practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            She brings deep insight into the emotional and practical realities faced by vulnerable learners and the teams who support them.
            That lived understanding now shapes every aspect of Meadow Pathways—from curriculum to compliance, to the warmth of a morning welcome.
          </p>

          <p class="subhead">Connection with nature</p>
          <p>
            Nature is a constant thread in Zoe’s work. As a former outdoor education instructor, she sees the outdoors not just as a backdrop, but as a space that offers something different to everyone.
            Whether it’s a walk along the Cornish coast, a forest school session, or cooking with foraged ingredients, Zoe believes that nature offers regulation, joy, and connection for young people, staff, and the wider community.
            It’s this blend of care, creativity, and purpose that makes Meadow Pathways feel not just like a service, but a place to belong.
