    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Our vision is to create an inclusive educational centre that provides a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for children and young people who are facing Social, Emotional, and Mental Health (SEMH) challenges, as well as Special Educational Needs (SEN). With mental health concerns on the rise—especially among young people in the wake of the pandemic—it is vital to create spaces that prioritise emotional well-being and support. Cornwall, where we are based, is an area marked by high levels of deprivation and isolation, both of which significantly impact the mental health of local children. Our centre aims to address these challenges by fostering connection, growth, and resilience through personalised, child-centred learning.</p>
    
    <p>Our EOTAS focus will be on promoting emotional well-being through purposeful, nature-based activities, mindfulness practices, and therapeutic interventions. These activities are designed to build confidence, enhance emotional regulation, and foster a sense of belonging within a supportive and inclusive community. We believe in the transformative power of nature and meaningful engagement to help young people develop emotional resilience and the skills necessary to thrive.</p>
    
    <p>We will provide an individualised learning experience that supports emotional needs. With over 30 years of combined experience in supporting students with SEMH and SEN, the founders bring a wealth of expertise. One of the founders has over a decade of experience in SEMH and SEN school settings, dedicated their career to supporting young people who find traditional education challenging. They have taught a wide range of lessons to students aged 6 to 18, with a strong emphasis on Outdoor Education and Forest School, building on their qualification as a Secondary PE teacher gained five years ago.</p>
    
    <p>Their passion lies in developing individualised, student-centred pathways to help reintegrate learners back into school environments, offering tailored support that meets each student’s unique needs. Currently, they lead a diverse, highly skilled team of staff who specialise in supporting students with Education, Health, and Care Plans (EHCPs), and hold whole-school responsibility for timetabling to ensure a broad and engaging curriculum is delivered effectively. At the heart of their practice is a commitment to building positive relationships, which has consistently been the foundation of their success. It is this core value that now drives them to help establish a truly unique and nurturing educational setting, designed to support and empower the youth of today.</p>
    
    <p>The other founding member has built a varied and impactful career in education and support services. Starting out as an HLTA, they went on to develop the role of Parent and Child Support Worker before stepping into senior leadership as Deputy Head and Safeguarding Lead.</p>
    
    <p>With a professional background in therapy, they bring a deep understanding of emotional wellbeing to their work, helping to embed a nurturing, therapeutic approach throughout the provision. Their focus on collaboration and support extends to staff, students, and families alike, fostering an environment where everyone feels safe, valued, and heard.</p>
    
    <p>They oversee a key area of the setting alongside an Assistant Head and lead the Family Support and Safeguarding Team. With extensive experience working with children who have social and emotional needs, they are especially passionate about building strong relationships and supporting young people to grow in confidence, overcome barriers, and thrive.</p>
    
    <p>Together, they are deeply committed to creating a space where each student feels valued, supported, and empowered to succeed.</p>
    
    <p>The ultimate goal of our centre is to provide a safe, secure environment where learning and emotional healing go hand-in-hand. By offering tailored support, we aim to help students build resilience, form positive relationships, and gain the tools they need to engage with life confidently and with strength.</p>
