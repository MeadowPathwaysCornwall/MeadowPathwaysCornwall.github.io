      <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that every child deserves to feel safe, understood, and empowered. Our work is guided by the SPACE approach — Safety, Presence, Attunement, Connection, and Empowerment — and shaped by the unique needs of each young person and family we support.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work flexibly across community settings — from woodland walks to beach sessions, creative play to curriculum support — always led by the child’s needs and readiness. Our aim is to build confidence, resilience, and a renewed sense of possibility.
