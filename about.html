        <h3>Michelle Pascoe — Director & Founder</h3>
        <p>
          Michelle is a founding director and Lead Therapist for <strong>Meadow Pathways Wellbeing and Education Cornwall</strong>.

        </p>
        <p>
          With over 20 years of experience, Michelle is a qualified counsellor and play therapist. She spent more than a decade in an independent SEN school, beginning as a HLTA and progressing to senior leadership, where she served as Designated Safeguarding Lead for over seven years.
